    <h3 class="Question">The howling grows louder as you get closer to the city. That can only mean one thing…  Fleshrippers. Not everyone escaped the nuclear bombs. Most people died on impact, but those who did not, completely lost their minds. They wander the cities in search of whatever meat they can find… Even if it'/s still breathing. You'/re still about five miles from the city.</h3>
    <ul class="AnswerChoices">
        <li id = "Answer">Forge on and arrive in the city by nightfall.</li>
        <li id = "Answer">Take cover in an abandoned vehicle near the entrance of the city. Wait until morning to enter the confines of the city.</li>
        <li id = "Answer">Instead of going directly through the city, try for the abandoned suburban edges.</li>
        <li id = "Answer">Climb the tallest structure you can find, sleep about three miles outside of the city for safety. Attempt to enter in the morning.</li>
