    <h1>And so our journey begins...</h1>
    <h3>To begin your journey, you must pick a route. The North-West route meanders through the high ground in the mountains. It will be freezing and a long journey, but potentially safer. The quickest route would be due West, directly through the city remains. It will be treacherous, but give you the opportunity to forage for supplies. Finally, you can go South-West, and wade through the swamps of Myra, risking disease and toxic muck.</h3>
